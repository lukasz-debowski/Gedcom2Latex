# Gedcom2Latex

This repository contains my Perl script for extracting genealogical
trees from GEDCOM databases (Ancestris, Gramps, Family Tree Maker) and
typesetting them in Latex using the genealogytree.sty package from
CTAN (to be downloaded independently). The repository contains the
gedcom2latex.pl script and an example of its usage.
